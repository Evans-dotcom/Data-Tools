# 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

This project demonstrates an **Event Ticketing Database** implemented using Supabase (PostgreSQL).
It integrates Row Level Security (RLS), Admin & User roles, and custom SQL policies to control data access and enforce least privilege principles.

The System includes:  
- ✅ Tables for events, customers, tickets, and payments
- ✅ UUID-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- ✅ Role-based access policies (Admin vs Regular User)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ A secure function for admin-only operations

---

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- **Supabase** – PostgreSQL + Auth + Policy Management  
- **PostgreSQL** – Structured database engine and tables  
- **RLS Policies** - Fine-grained access control
- **SQL Functions** – Role-based admin actions

## 🚀 Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

- [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites
- Supabase account  
- PostgreSQL basics  
- Git installed  

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DENNIS-MURITHI/music-streaming-database.git
cd music-streaming-database
```

```bash
Usage

Open Supabase SQL editor

Run schema.sql to create tables & sample data

Apply UUID + RLS setup:

ALTER TABLE user_favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE songs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE artists ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;


Apply user vs admin policies.
```

---

## 💾 Sample SQL Queries & Policies <a name="sample-sql-queries"></a>

### 1️⃣ User Policies
```sql
-- Users can view only their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own favorites"
ON user_favorites
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_uuid);
```

```sql
-- Users can insert their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own favorites"
ON user_favorites
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_uuid);
```

```sql
-- Users can read all songs & artists
CREATE POLICY "Users can read all songs"
ON songs
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read all artists"
ON artists
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

---

### 2️⃣ Admin Policies
```sql
-- Admins can manage all favorites
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all favorites"
ON user_favorites
FOR ALL
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE user_uuid = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'));
```

```sql
-- Admins can manage all songs
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all songs"
ON songs
FOR ALL
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE user_uuid = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'));
```

```sql
-- Admins can manage all artists
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all artists"
ON artists
FOR ALL
USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE user_uuid = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'));
```

---

### 3️⃣ Example CRUD Queries with their output.
```sql
-- List all songs liked by Alice
SELECT u.username, s.title, a.name AS artist_name
FROM user_favorites uf
JOIN users u ON uf.user_uuid = u.user_uuid
JOIN songs s ON uf.song_id = s.song_id
JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
WHERE u.username = 'alice';
```

## User Roles and Output

**User add new songs to their favorited**
```sql
-- Insert favorite (User only)
INSERT INTO user_favorites (user_uuid, song_id)
VALUES ('2d953804-5827-4f73-bfd5-41d83d53762f', 8);
```
```sql
SELECT s.title AS song, a.name AS artist
FROM user_favorites uf
JOIN songs s ON uf.song_id = s.song_id
JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
WHERE uf.user_uuid = '2d953804-5827-4f73-bfd5-41d83d53762f';
```
  **Ouput upon updating their favorited**

  **User can also delete their favorite songs**

```sql
DELETE FROM user_favorites
WHERE user_uuid = '2d953804-5827-4f73-bfd5-41d83d53762f'  AND song_id = 8;
```
**Output upon deleting song with id=8**

## Admin Roles and Output

**A view of the songs before updating**

```sql
SELECT song_id, title, artist_id
FROM songs
WHERE song_id = 1;
```

**Song Output after Admin update the title**
```sql
-- Update a song (Admin only)
UPDATE songs SET title = 'Programmers choice' WHERE song_id = 1;
```

```sql
-- Delete a song (Admin only)
DELETE FROM artists WHERE song_id = 1;
```

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: How do I test RLS policies?**  
A: Sign in as User vs Admin and try CRUD operations. Policies will restrict or allow access accordingly.  

**Q: Can I extend this to a front-end?**  
A: Yes, connect Supabase Auth with React, Next.js, or any front-end framework.
